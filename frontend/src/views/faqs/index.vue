          What is an MRI?
        </summary>
        <div class="space-y-2">
          <p>
            Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic imaging technique
            that combines a powerful magnetic field with computer technology to
            produce exquisitely detailed images of your body's soft tissue
            (organs, muscles, fat). Because certain atoms in our cells respond,
            or resonate, slightly in the presence of magnetic fields, MRI is
            able to use that response to create an amazingly clear, detailed
            computer representation of internal organs, muscles, connective
            tissue, and the central nervous system. Using cross-sectional
            imaging of the body along multiple planes (like slices of bread),
            the clarity of these images is far greater than is available with
            conventional CT scans, X-rays, or even myelograms, allowing your
            physician to make an earlier and more accurate diagnosis. MRI is
            noninvasive (except in cases where contrast agents are injected).

          Is there radiation in an MRI?
        </summary>
        <div class="space-y-2">
          <p>
            No. MRI doesn't expose patients to radioactive materials, X-ray, or
            any form of ionizing radiation. To the best of our knowledge, MRI
            produces no harmful side effects.

          What happens during an MR Arthrogram?
        </summary>
        <div class="space-y-2">
          <p>
            An MR arthrogram begins with the application of a local anesthetic
            to the area being scanned. A radiologist then injects the affected
            area with a small amount of contrast agent under the guidance of
            X-ray. Then, you will proceed to the MR room for imaging of the
            joint. During the scan, you may relax and listen to music while more
            images are being taken. Following the test, the images will be
            reviewed and prepared for interpretation by our radiologists. The
            results are then forwarded to the referring physician, who will be
            responsible for discussing the results with you.

          How long will an MRI scan take?

          <p>
            MRI scans vary from 20 to 60 minutes, depending on what part of the
            body is being analyzed and how many images are required.
          </p>
          <p>
            If, after the first MRI scan, the images are not clear enough for
            the radiologist, they may ask the patient to undergo a second scan
            straight away.

          I have braces or filings, should I still undergo the scan?

          Although braces and fillings are unaffected by the scan, they may
          distort certain images. The doctor and technician will discuss this
          beforehand. The MRI scan may take longer if additional images are
          required.

          Can I move while I am in the MRI tunnel?

        <p>
          It is important to stay as still as possible while in the MRI scanner.
          Any movement will distort the scanner and, therefore, the images
          produced will be blurry. In particularly long MRI scans, the MRI
          technician may allow a short break halfway through the procedure.

          Can I have an MRI scan if I am pregnant?
        </summary>
        <div class="space-y-2">
          <p>
            Unfortunately, there is no simple answer. Let a doctor know about
            the pregnancy before the scan. There have been relatively few
            studies on the effect of MRI scans on pregnancy. However, guidelines
            published in 2016 have shed more light on the issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, doctors do not recommend contrast material for women who
            are pregnant.
          </p>
          <p>
            MRI scans should be restricted during the first trimester unless the
            information is considered essential. MRI scans during the second and
            third trimester are safe at 3.0 tesla (T) or less. The tesla is a
            measurement of magnetic strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            The guidelines also state that exposure to MRI during the first
            trimester is not linked to long-term consequences and should not
            raise clinical concerns.
