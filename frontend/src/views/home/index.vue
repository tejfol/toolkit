      <p class="text-lg font-medium xl:w-6/12">
        The brain is the most complex part in the human body. This three-pound
        organ is responsible for our intelligence, interpreting sensation,
        initiating body movement, and controlling all of our behaviors.

            The brain and the rest of the central nervous system are composed of
            a variety of cells, but the primary functional unit is a cell called
            a neuron. All sensations, movements, , memories, and feelings are
            the result of signals that pass through neurons of differing shapes,
            sizes, and functions. The average brain contains 80-90 billion
            neurons, the cell bodies of which form "gray matter." Many, many
            more specialized cells called "glia" protect and support neurons in
            gray matter, and provide insulation for their delicate
            interconnections (called axons) in the "white matter." The folds in
            the human brain form sulci (grooves) and gyri (ridges), adding to
            its surface area to maximize the number of cells that can pack into
            our skulls, and increasing the quantity of information we can
            process.

            Over hundreds of years, scientists have learned much about the
            brain, including the countless methods through which information is
            transferred from neuron to neuron at a junction called a synapse,
            and how hundreds - even thousands - of neurons can function together
            to form a larger circuit responsible for any given activity. All
            human brains share basic anatomical circuits and synaptic
            interactions, but the precise pattern of connections and
            interactions are highly variable from person to personâ€”and therein
            lies the source of the remarkable variation we see in human behavior
            - from the breathtaking dance of a ballerina, to the elegant
            craftsmanship of a master carpenter, to the shrewd judgment of an
            expert trader. Remodeling its circuitry with each new experience -
            our brain makes us who we are, enabling us to perceive beauty, teach
            our children, remember loved ones, react against injustice, learn
            from history, and imagine a different future.
